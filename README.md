# **Threaded Grimoire**

**Threaded Grimoire** is a personal tool to manage and organize crochet patterns, stitches, and future inspiration. Designed to help you keep track of all your crochet projects, the tool includes a catalogue for completed projects, a library for stitches, and more features to come.

## **Description**

Threaded Grimoire is a project for crocheters (especially beginners) to organize their work. Currently, it includes the following:

- **Catalogue**: Store and review all the patterns you've already completed.
- **Library**: A collection of stitch names, along with tutorials and descriptions, to guide your work.
  
In the future, I plan to add:

- **Inspiration/Future Projects Section**: Store links to patterns youâ€™d like to try or draw inspiration from.
- **Pattern Creator**: A tool to create custom crochet patterns while you work.

## **Technologies and Tools**

Threaded Grimoire is built using HTML, CSSS and JavaScript. 

### **Future Roadmap**

**Planned Features:**

- **Inspiration/Future Projects Section**: Save links to patterns that inspire you or ones you want to try in the future.
- **Pattern Creator**: Create custom crochet patterns while crocheting, with the ability to input and adjust stitch counts and designs as you work.


## ** Next steps **
- **Main page**: Add Link to GH repo. 
- **Catalogue**: Catalogue main page (CSSS); Pattern display (CSSS).
- **Create pattern**: Learn JS prior to starting this page.
